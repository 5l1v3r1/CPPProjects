# CPPProjects 

This is a collection of C++ projects 

## How To Build / Run

Currently this is built in Visual Studio 2019.\
In order to build and run the projects you must open the main CPPProjects.sln in VS and then set the startup project to "Current Selection" or whichever project you'd like to run.\
Future plans are to create a "Manager" startup project of sorts that will let you choose any project  from it.
